== Description ==

This is a simple implementation for Parse.com Push Service (for iOS, Android, Windows 8 or any other devices may add). 
You can send a push notification via admin panel or with a post update/creation. In addition, you can include post's id as extra parameter to use it as you want with your mobile app, select the channels you want to receive notifications or add an extra parameter to the payload (any key/value pair you like).

**NOTICE:**
In order to use this plugin you MUST have an account with Parse.com and cURL ENABLED.

**WARNING:**
Wordpress, in order to publish a scheduled post, runs a pseudo-cron job WHEN a user visits the site. Any user, any page (admin page or a page a visitor sees).
SO, if for example you have scheduled a post for publish at 16:00 and this website doesn't have a hit until 16:50, the post will actually be published at 16:50 and the Push Notification will be sent at 16:50.<br/>
Keep that in mind!

== Installation ==

1. Upload `simple-parse-push-service` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Setup 'Application name', 'ApplicationID', 'REST API Key' according to your parse.com application

Go to http://www.anindya.com/php-5-4-3-and-php-5-3-13-x64-64-bit-for-windows/ and download the curl version that corresponds to your php version under "Fixed curl extensions:".
